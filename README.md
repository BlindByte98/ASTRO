## ‚ú® Features

### Realistic Simulation

- **Celestial Bodies**: Models a range of star types and planetary systems with scientifically accurate properties.
- **Star Systems**: Simulates single and multi-star systems with realistic mass distributions. Stars are dynamically positioned based on their mass and gravitational influence.
- **Planets and Moons**: Generates planets and moons with realistic sizes, orbits, and rotational properties. Each object‚Äôs velocity and position are calculated to ensure stable, physically accurate interactions.
- **Orbital Mechanics**: Uses Newtonian gravity and elliptical orbits to model planetary and moon trajectories. Advanced orbital dynamics include accurate velocities and escape velocities to prevent unrealistic spiraling.
- **Asteroids and Nebulae**: Incorporates asteroid fields and nebulae with procedurally generated particles for added realism.
- **Dynamic Rings**: Supports the creation of ring systems around planets with realistic textures and dynamic indicators.

### Detailed Physical Properties

- **Mass and Gravity**: Celestial bodies are assigned realistic masses and gravitational constants, affecting their interactions and orbital behavior.
- **Size and Scale**: Objects are scaled based on real astronomical measurements, ensuring accurate relative sizes and distances.
- **Velocity and Acceleration**: Implements realistic velocities for objects, preventing issues like spiraling into the central star. Velocity calculations account for gravitational forces and initial placements.
- **Spin and Rotation**: Incorporates dynamic spin rates and rotational properties for stars, planets, and moons, based on astrophysical data.

### Immersive Visuals

- **Textures and Materials**: Applies detailed textures and realistic materials to celestial objects, enhancing visual fidelity.
- **Lighting**: Utilizes ambient and point lighting to simulate natural illumination, including effects like star brightness and planetary shadows.
- **Post-Processing Effects**: Includes bloom and other post-processing effects for a more cinematic and immersive experience.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Provides intuitive camera controls for an immersive user experience, allowing users to explore the simulation from various angles.
